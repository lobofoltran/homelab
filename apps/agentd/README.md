# agentd

**agentd** is a passive agent that runs as a daemon (background service), executing configurable local jobs, sending data to a central system (`tower`), and operating in distributed environments like servers, VMs, or embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi.

The project aims to solve data pipeline issues in environments with VPNs — that's why it is pull-based, allowing for extension and the creation of data pipelines.

## Features

- Executes **periodic jobs** based on a local JSON configuration
- Each job runs with its own interval
- Collects and stores local data
- Cross-platform (Linux, MacOS and Windows)
